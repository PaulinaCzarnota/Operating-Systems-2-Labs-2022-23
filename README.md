This repository contains my completed labs from the Operating Systems 2 course during my second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

The labs were developed on Linux Ubuntu using bash commands and feature various C programs that focus on essential concepts such as process management, threading, inter-process communication, data structures, and memory management.

## Key Programs Include:

- **Linked Lists:** Implementation and traversal of linked lists, along with operations for stacks and queues using linked structures.

- **Process Management:** Programs demonstrating process creation and synchronization techniques using semaphores and mutexes.

- **Multi-threading:** Solutions to the producer-consumer problem implemented with POSIX threads and semaphores.

- **Matrix Operations:** Implementations for matrix transposition and multiplication, utilizing various pointer techniques.

Each program aims to enhance understanding of operating system principles and improve practical programming skills in C.
