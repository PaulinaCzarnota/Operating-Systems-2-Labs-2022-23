This repository contains my completed labs from the Operating Systems 2 course in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. It features various C programs that focus on key concepts such as process management, threading, inter-process communication, data structures, and memory management.

### Key Programs Include:
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation and traversal of linked lists, including stack and queue operations using linked structures.
- **Process Management**: Programs demonstrating fork processes and synchronization techniques using semaphores and mutexes.
- **Multi-threading**: Examples of producer-consumer problems solved using POSIX threads and semaphores.
- **Matrix Operations**: Implementations for matrix transposition and multiplication, utilizing various pointer techniques.

Each program aims to enhance understanding of operating system principles and practical programming skills in C.
